# Newsletter Stats

A work-in-progress analysis of some of the newsletters that I subscribe to.

You can find the most recent results in [docs/report.md](./docs/report.md)
as well as an explanation of methods and data.
The Jupyter notebook [analysis.ipynb](./analysis.ipynb) implements the analysis.

Results include the [Flesh-Kincaid test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flesch%E2%80%93Kincaid_readability_tests#Flesch%E2%80%93Kincaid_grade_level)
US grade levels of posts and comments as detailed in [docs/report.md](docs/report.md).

I've also looked into the distribution of comments per a post.
